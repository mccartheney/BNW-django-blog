# Justification for Framework Choice

The choice of [Django](link-to-django-website) as the framework for this project was based on several technical considerations:

- **Rapid Development:** Django offers a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities that enable rapid and efficient development of web applications.
  
- **Security:** Django comes with built-in security features, such as protection against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which help ensure the security of the application.

- **Scalability:** Django is highly scalable, allowing the application to grow as needed to handle larger volumes of traffic and content.

- **Abundant Documentation:** Django's extensive documentation provides detailed resources and practical examples that facilitate learning and development with the framework.
